// # [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator

// #### Challenge 1: Flavor Selection

let userPreference = 'Sugar-free'; // Possible values: 'Regular', 'Sugar-free', or undefined
console.log(userPreference ? (userPreference === 'Sugar-Free'? 'Sugar-free': 'Regular') : 'Regular');

// #### Challenge 2: Stock Check


let cansLeft = 3; // Any number of cans
console.log(cansLeft < 5 ? 'Time to restock! ðŸ“‰'  : "We're stocked! ðŸ“ˆ" );


// #### Challenge 3: Workout Intensity

let heartRate = 95; // Current heart rate in bpm
console.log(heartRate < 100 ? `Boost needed! ðŸª«` : 'Energy levels are high! ðŸ”‹');


// #### Challenge 4: Temperature Suitability


let currentTemp = 4; // Current temperature in Â°C
console.log( currentTemp <= 5 ? `Chilled to perfection! ðŸ¥¶` : 'Needs a cooler! ðŸ†’');


// #### Challenge 5: Late Night Coding Session
let currentHour = 22; 
console.log( currentHour >= 7 && currentHour <= 24 ? `Unleash the beast! ðŸ˜¤` : 'Better stick to water.ðŸ˜•');

// Write your code below this line to determine if it's a good idea to have a Monster Energy drink based on the current hour
// If it's between 7am and midnight (24-hour format), print "Unleash the beast!"
// Otherwise, print "Better stick to water."






// In each of these challenges, the ternary operator is used to decide between two options based on a condition, 
// demonstrating its utility for concise conditional logic. Remember that while ternaries can make the code more succinct, 
// they should be used judiciously to maintain readability, especially for more complex conditions.
